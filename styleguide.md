### Comments

Place comments one space after the end of a line. Example:

```
alert("Hello"); // Makes an alert that says hello.
```

However, in this example, comments are unnecessary. Only  put comments in places that need them or at the beginning of function of method declarations.

### Variables

Use camelcase in all variables. Examples:

```
var thisIsCamelCase = "Make the start of every word in a variable capitalized.";
```

### Indentation

Use four spaces to indent. Please don't use two spaces, and definitely **don't** use tabs. **PLEASE**.
